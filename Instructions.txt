The document proposes a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based optimization model to minimize a composite objective function. This model considers both bandwidth cost and load balancing at both the network and server level.

The proposed strategy focuses on minimizing bandwidth cost and load balancing to reduce overall delay in the fog-cloud computing environment.

The strategy uses two types of resources: network resources (bandwidth) and server resources (CPUs' processing capacity), making it a unified model for resource optimization between the network and servers.

The document conducts a series of systematic studies using different weight factors associated with each goal of the composite objective function to analyze the trade-off between bandwidth cost and load balancing.

The proposed strategy fills a significant gap in the research by considering the joint optimization of bandwidth cost and load balancing in a cooperative fog-cloud computing environment.
